        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sushi Rice</li>
            <li>Rice Vinegar</li>
            <li>Nori</li>
            <li>Sesame Seeds</li>
            <li>Sushi Fillings: Crab, Avocado, Cucumber</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the sushi rice with the rice vinegar, fanning and stirring until room temperature.</li>
            <li>On a rolling mat, place one sheet of nori with the rough side facing upwards.</li>
            <li>Wet your hands and grab a handful of rice and place it on the nori. Spread the rice evenly throughout the nori without mashing the rice down.<br>
                Season rice with a pinch of sesame seeds, if using, then flip it over so the nori is facing upwards.</li>
            <li>Arrange, in a horizontal row 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom, the crab followed by a row of avocado and a row of cucumber.</li>
            <li>Grabbing both nori and the mat, roll the mat over the filling so the extra space at the bottom touches the other side, squeezing down to make <br>
                a nice tight roll. Squeeze down along the way to keep the roll from holding its shape.</li>
            <li>Transfer the roll onto a cutting board. Rub a knife on a damp paper towel before slicing the roll into six equal portions.</li>
        </ol>
